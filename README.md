# Hey Hey Hey, it's a PARTYðŸŽ‰

## This is my do over party in my career in tech and in Github as well. Life has really made me realize how each day I am alive, I need to celebrate. In the mist of everything I have one take away that I will like to share, <em>When you start to become unhappy in your moment, it is time for a change!</em> <br> <br>My change is here and now and since there is no turning back, I am going to share this with you:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: <br>
* All things JAMStack!!! - I have been MIA and I really want to dive in DEEP into this stack
* Picking up TailwindCSS
* Maybe dab in a little bit of UI/UX design systems for developers

ðŸŒ± What I want to learn in the future: <br>
* Serverless Functions and Headless CMS (old habits die hard with WP but I will experiment with others, I promise ðŸ˜Š)
* Laravel Ecosystem - Really want to step outside the box and experiment a tincy bit!
* Picking up a little native iOS development

âš¡ Fun fact about me is that my name has always been mispronounced because it is !spelled correctly since birth, AIN'T NO BODY GOT TIME TO CHANGE IT, this is why I never get mad or frustrated when it is pronounced wrong ðŸ¤£
